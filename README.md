Placeholder project for an idea - mobile app to generate random workout steps

Very rough idea - allow a user to define a list of exercises (pushups, situps, planks, squats, etc.), units per each exercise
(reps, minutes, etc) and maximum possible per round. The app then simply generates random workout steps (do 12 pushups, 
jump rope for 6 minutes, do 18 squuats, etc)
